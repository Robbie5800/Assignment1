<h2 style="margin-left: 36px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 36px;">Shakespeare Generator</h2>
<div class="leftAligned">
   <p class="text-box">I built a Shakespearean-style text generator using a recurrent neural network (RNN) that produces language one character at a time, learning patterns in spelling, rhythm, and structure directly from the training data.Rather than predicting full words, the model incrementally constructs text letter by letter, allowing it to emulate archaic phrasing and dramatic cadence. The project demonstrates how sequence models can capture linguistic style while highlighting both the strengths and quirks of character-level neural generation.</p>

    <p class="text-box" style="margin-left: 150px;">I developed a Wordle solver that uses a strategic algorithm to efficiently narrow down possible word choices based on feedback from previous guesses. The solver analyzes the color-coded hints provided by the game, systematically eliminating words that don't match the known letter placements and frequencies. By prioritizing guesses that maximize information gain, the solver can quickly converge on the correct answer, demonstrating how computational techniques can enhance problem-solving in word games.</p>

<h2 style="margin-left: 36px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 36px;">Plant Disease Identifier</h2>
<div class="leftAligned">
   <p class="text-box">This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based image classifier designed to detect plant diseases in tomatoes, potatoes, and apples. The model is trained on labeled leaf images to automatically learn visual features such as texture, color variation, and lesion patterns. By analyzing these spatial characteristics, the classifier can distinguish between healthy plants and multiple disease categories. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how deep learning can support early disease detection in agriculture, helping improve crop monitoring and reduce yield loss through faster, data-driven diagnosis.</p>
